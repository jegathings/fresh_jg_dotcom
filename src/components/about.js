                I am a recent graduate of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Remote program.  I spent 12 weeks learning cool technologies such javascript, nodejs, react, mongodb, netlifly, and heroku.  In the past I spent about 15 years developing backend java applications.  I am looking forward to combining all of those cool experiences into future projects.
